            <h2>1. Service Description</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Ticket System</h3>
            <p>The Service utilizes a virtual currency known as "Tickets" to access premium features, including but not limited to starting new interview sessions.</p>

                <li>One Ticket is typically consumed per interview session, though this amount is subject to change.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Refunds</h3>
